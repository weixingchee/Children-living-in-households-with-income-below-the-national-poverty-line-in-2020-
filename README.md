Children Living in Households with Income Below the National Poverty Line in 2020: An Overview

Poverty is a pervasive problem in many countries around the world, and its impact is felt most acutely by children. Children living in households with income below the national poverty line face a range of challenges, including limited access to quality education, healthcare, and basic necessities like food and shelter. In this essay, we will examine the prevalence of child poverty in 2020, the characteristics of children living in poverty, and the implications of poverty on their lives and future prospects.

According to data from the United Nations, an estimated 385 million children around the world were living in extreme poverty in 2020. This represents a staggering 12.6% of all children globally. In the United States, the poverty rate for children under 18 was 15.8% in 2020, with an estimated 11.9 million children living in poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the issue of child poverty, with many families experiencing job losses and reduced income.

Children living in poverty are more likely to experience a range of negative outcomes compared to their peers who grow up in households with higher incomes. These negative outcomes can include lower academic achievement, poorer health outcomes, and decreased social mobility. Children living in poverty are also more likely to experience food insecurity, which can have long-term implications on their health and development.
